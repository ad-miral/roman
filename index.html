  <p>We all know the Holiday Season can be the most expensive part of the year, every year expenses creep up. We're using more services, the cost of food and other goods continues to go up, and life is simply becoming more expensive.

  Most people don't take the time to do a quick personal audit to see where they are paying more than they need to, or where expenses could be cut all together.</p>
  <p>A quick 5 minute analysis can identify areas where huge savings could be found -- so that you can spend more money on things you actually like this December.</p>
  <p>Read through each item on the list below to see just how much you could save before the Holiday season kicks off. </strong>...</p>
  <hr />

  <h3>#1 - Stay On Top Of Your Electric Bill </h3>
  <p><img src="images/unplug.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Next to monthly housing payments, heat and electric bills are often the biggest expense around the home. Note the options below to start saving on these big expenses with immediate results...</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Unplug Everything:</strong> you know that appliances and electronics continue sapping electricity as long as they're plugged in, even when their switches are turned off? Making a habit of unplugging these items when they aren't in use saves a lot of energy over time. This includes computers, TVs, the toaster, hair dryers and phone chargers.</li>
    <li><strong>Use energy-efficient light bulbs:</strong> Replace all of your incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) or LED bulbs. Incandescent bulbs release most of their energy through heat, rather than light. Newer bulb styles are much more energy efficient, and they save a lot of electricity and money over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Smart Technology:</strong> How many times does the TV get left on with nobody watching it? Use timers and smart outlets to automatically turn off items at designated times or after a certain amount of time of inactivity. Smart thermostats can also make your home more energy efficient by automatically adjusting the temperature when you're away.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These things may seem small, but small amounts of energy over time can create big bills! Often times electric bills are made up of a lot of unnecessary usage -- and that's money that could be better spent elsewhere (or put back in your pocket).</p>

  <h3>#2 - Homeowners Get $3,252/year Taken Off Their Mortgage with the Government's Lucrative "FMERR" Program</h3>
  <p><img src="images/homexmas.png" /></p>
  <p>To all Homeowners: <strong>this one thing could really cut your expenses this year</strong>...</p>
  <p>Not many are aware of the sensible Government Program referred to as the <strong><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="Offerclass">FMERR (Freddie Mac Enhanced Relief Refinance Program) </a></strong> that could benefit millions of Americans and <strong>reduce their mortgage payments by as much as $3,252 per year!</strong> You can bet the banks aren't too thrilled about losing all that profit and might secretly hope homeowners don't find out about the program.</p>
  <p>So while the banks happily wait for this program to end, the Government is <strong>making a final push and urging homeowners to take advantage</strong>. This program is currently active but could be shut down at any given time. The good news is that once you're in, you're in.</p>
  <p>So if <strong>reducing your payments by $271/month</strong>, paying off your mortgage faster, or even taking some cash out would help you, it's important to <strong><a style="color:purple" href="" target="_blank" class="Offerclass">check your eligibility for free here</a></strong>. Checking your eligibility is quick and completely free!</p>

  <h3>#4 - Throw an Aspirin in the Wash and Be Left Speechless</h3>
  <p><img src="images/asprinwash.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Only aspirin can compete with bleaches and the top stain removing agents.This amazing tip will save your white laundry (and there's a bottle of expired, worthless aspirin somewhere around the house).</p>
  <p>Here's how to do it:</p>
  <p>Start by dissolving (5) 300mg aspirin tablets in 2 gallons of hot water. Crush the pills beforehand to speed up the process. The next thing to do is soak your white laundry in the mixture, and leave it overnight. In the morning, place the clothes in the washing machine, add a few aspirin pills again, and wash them as usually.</p>
  <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> This is a tip shared by one of our readers. Be sure to test this method out yourself before using it on clothes you care about (although we have not received any reports of bad experiences).</p>

  <h3>#5 Get a Big Break On Homeowners Insurance</h3>
  <p><img src="images/homeins2.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Let's face it... everyone needs homeowners insurance, and the insurance companies know that. But how often do you actually use your insurance? Probably not enough to make up for the cost year after year. <strong>Home insurance should not be expensive.</strong></p>
  <p>Here's the dirty little secret the insurance industry doesn't want you to know...</p>
  <p>Homeowners insurance is actually pretty inexpensive, but <strong>most people are paying far too much.</strong> In fact, as many as 57% of adults are overpaying for their home insurance. But that's all coming to an end thanks to popular <strong><a>homeowners insurance comparison sites</a></strong>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <hr />



  <h3>#6 - Rent Out the Spare Room</h3>
  <p><img src="images/spareroom.jpg" /></p>
  <p>This one can put a little extra in the pocket, just by maximizing unused space in the house.</p>
  <p>It's becoming increasingly common for homeowners to harness the earning potential of their property by renting out space to tenants or tourists. Rentership in the U.S. is near a 50-year high, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, with <strong>35.6 percent of the population renting</strong> rather than owning a home as of the third quarter of 2018.</p>
  <p>A large share of potential renters can make becoming a landlord attractive. Whether you have an English basement or a spare guest room, Airbnb has made short-term rentals fun and lucrative. On average, those who rent on Airbnb earn 4.5x more than if they were to rent to a tenant as a traditional landlord. That figure also accounts for a 30% vacancy rate, so there are things definitely attractive about this model.</p>
  <p>To market on Airbnb, you're required to report the additional income you receive. But that income can easily cover the mortgage and other expenses. There's also the added benefit of being able to <strong>deduct any repairs and improvements</strong> made to that rental space!</p>
  <p>P.S. Don't' want to rent out a bedroom, you could always rent out extra storage area or garage space!</p>

 <!-- <h3>#7 - Enjoy Monthly Savings on Car Insurance (Saves $500 or More)</h3>
  <p><img src="images/famcarins.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Did you know that depending on your age and other factors, car owners could get a generous discount on their car insurance? Recent studies indicate that only 5% of American drivers over the age of 50 are paying less than $64 per month for car insurance. That's a lot of people <strong>paying a lot more than they may need to!</strong></p>
  <p>This is probably because most are not taking advantage of the multiple discounts available to them.

  <h3>#8 - Use Soda to Clean The Most Stubborn Areas of Your Home</h3>
  <p><img src="images/coketoilet.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Who knew one of the world's most enjoyed drinks could be such a practical household staple? Coke is similar to an acidic cleaner. The quantity of acid in soda is sufficient to erode at the enamel of your teeth, making them more vulnerable to decay. So why buy those expensive cleaners when you can perfectly clean those stubborn stains with Coke. You can use it for a variety of household chores, such as...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove grease stains from clothing and fabric</li>
    <li>Clean a toilet; pour around bowl, leave for a while, flush clean</li>
    <li>Clean tile grout; pour onto kitchen floor, leave for a few minutes, wipe up.</li>
    <li>Descale your kettle</li>
    <li>Remove marker stains from your carpet. Apply Coke, scrub and then clean with soapy water</li>
    <li>Clean your windows; soak a cloth with Coke and rub your window. Then simply wash the glass pane with water</li>
  </ul>

<h3>#9 - Federal "Cash Savings Program" Gives an Average $21,573 for Home Improvements</h3>
  <p><img src="images/darkkitchen01.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Homeowners across the country are using the new Federal "Cash Savings Program" that <strong>puts an average of $21,573 back into the home owner's pocket</strong>, which can be used to pay for home improvements and other expenses.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="Remodel">» Check Your Eligibility Here</a></strong></p>
  <p>Millions of homeowners have already taken advantage of this incentive, but an estimated 40 million homeowners could still be eligible to receive their cash savings <strong>as early as this October</strong> — and deadlines may be approaching soon.</p>
  <p>While most are using the incentive to pay for kitchen and bath remodels, others are getting new windows, the roof repaired, and updating appliances. Meanwhile others are using their cash savings to take a much needed vacation, pay off debt, and even fund a college savings plan.</p>
  <p>These programs are all thanks to the Government's effort to stimulate the economy by <strong>helping homeowners greatly reduce their monthly mortgage payment</strong> and boost home values across America, (</p>
  <p><span style="color: red;"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></span> Homeowners that have not yet filed to claim their savings are urged <strong>do so right away before deadlines are announced</strong>. Checking eligibility only takes about 60 seconds and is 100% free when using the the <strong><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="Remodel">Home Remodel Programs website</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that <strong>homeowners with a 600+ credit score and a mortgage balance over $105,000 are likely to qualify.</strong></p>

  <h3>#10 - Stock Up Your Fridge and Reduce Your Energy Bill</h3>
  <p><img src="images/fridge.jpg" /></p>
  <p>File this under strange-but-true: A full fridge regulates temperature better than an empty one. Open space in your refrigerator fills with warm air whenever you peek inside, making your poor appliance work overtime. Your grandparents' fridges were smaller and easier to fill, so it wasn't an issue for them. But today's larger fridge/freezers can waste significant energy.</p>
  <p>So go ahead, stock up on veggies, meat, and milk — just don't let your grocery costs run too high in the process. If you can't fill the fridge with usable food, place pitchers of water to take up the space. It's recommended to set your fridge between 36 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit for max efficiency.</p>
  <hr />

  <!--<h3>#10 - Bump Up Your Car's Fuel Economy</h3>
  <p><img src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-src="files/tirepress.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Did you know properly inflated tires can improve the fuel economy of a vehicle by as much as 3.3 percent</p>
  <p>The average car has a fuel economy of 24.7 miles per gallon. If you increase that by 3.3 percent, that's an annual cost savings of $193 just for having the right amount of air in the tires!</p>
  <p>That may not sound like a lot, but remember... small amounts of savings here and there can quickly add up to big amount of savings by the end of the year. Likewise, a lot of little expenses can add up to big monthly bills.</p>
